Lastweek we got an API error as server is down from jolo. they didn't inform me about the issue. the server problem resolved after 14 hrs. they sent mail server problem resolved.sorry for inconvenience. it is really irritating.because several times i observed that they do whatever they want without intimating to us.yesterday i got another problem,i got error message as \"Current API is not working,use our new API version.\". i searched for new API but i didn't find any new API.today at 2PM, they sent mail about the new API details.I followed instruction to shift old account to new API account. but they didn't updated shifting till now.i have been calling them,they didn't even answer the call. At least they should have inform us before 2 days,so that we can plan accordingly. I suggest don't ever buy Jolo API.it sucks.our reputation will be went down.",
